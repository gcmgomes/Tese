\section{Equitable Coloring}

As previously discussed, \pname{Equitable Coloring} seeks a $k$-coloring of the vertices of an $n$ vertex graph $G$ such that no color is used \say{too many times}. In particular, we want our color classes to have either $\floor{\frac{n}{k}}$ or $\ceil{\frac{n}{k}}$ vertices.
In this section, we present a dynamic programming \XP\ algorithm for \pname{Equitable Coloring}.
Moreover, we show that deciding whether or not a block graph $G$ is colorable with $\omega(G)$ colors is $\NPc$ in the strong sense.
Finally, constructive, polynomial time algorithms for \textsc{equitable coloring} on \{net, claw\}-free block graphs, claw-free block graphs and claw-free chordal graphs are presented.
