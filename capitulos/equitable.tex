\chapter{Equitable, Clique, and Biclique Coloring}
\label{ch:eq_coloring}

As previously discussed, equitable $k$-colorings seek a coloring of the vertices of an $n$ vertex graph $G$ such that no color is used \say{too many times}. In particular, we want our color classes to have either $\floor{\frac{n}{k}}$ or $\ceil{\frac{n}{k}}$ vertices.
In this chapter, we present a dynamic programming \XP\ algorithm for \pname{Equitable Coloring}.
Moreover, we show that deciding whether or not a block graph $G$ is colorable with $\omega(G)$ colors is $\NPc$ in the strong sense.
Finally, constructive, polynomial time algorithms for \textsc{equitable coloring} on \{net, claw\}-free block graphs, claw-free block graphs and claw-free chordal graphs are presented.
