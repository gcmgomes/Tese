\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

 A \tdef{cut} of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a bipartition of its vertex set $V(G)$ into two non-empty sets, denoted by $(A,B)$.
The set of all edges with one endpoint in $A$ and the other in $B$ is the \tdef{edge cut}, or the set of \tdef{crossing edges}, of $(A,B)$.
A \tdef{matching cut} is a (possibly empty) edge cut that is a matching, that is, such that its edges are pairwise vertex-disjoint. Equivalently, $(A, B)$ is a matching cut of $G$ if and only if every vertex is incident to at most one crossing edge of $(A, B)$~\cite{matching_cut_graham, chvatal_matching_cut}, that is, it has at most one neighbor across the cut.

Motivated by an open question posed by Komusiewicz et al.~\cite{matching_cut_ipec} during the presentation of their article,  we investigate a natural generalization that arises from this alternative definition, which we call \tdef{$d$-cut}. 
Namely, for a positive integer $d \geq 1$, a $d$-cut is a a cut $(A, B)$ such that each vertex has at most $d$ neighbors across the partition, that is, every vertex in $A$ has at most $d$ neighbors in $B$, and vice-versa. Note that a $1$-cut is a matching cut.
As expected, not every graph admits a $d$-cut, and the \pname{$d$-Cut} problem is the problem of, for a fixed integer $d \geq 1$, deciding whether or not an input graph $G$ has a $d$-cut.

%\probl{$d$-Cut}{A graph $G$.}{Does $G$ have a $d$-cut?}

When $d=1$, we refer to the problem as \pname{Matching Cut}.
Graphs with no matching cut first appeared in Graham's manuscript~\cite{matching_cut_graham} under the name of \textit{indecomposable graphs}, presenting some examples and properties of decomposable and indecomposable graphs, leaving their recognition as an open problem.
In answer to Graham's question, Chv\'atal~\cite{chvatal_matching_cut} proved that the problem is \NP-hard for graphs of maximum degree at least four and polynomially solvable for graphs of maximum degree at most three; in fact, as shown by Moshi~\cite{matching_cut_moshi}, every graph of maximum degree three and at least eight vertices has a matching cut.

Chvátal's results spurred a lot of research on the complexity of the problem~\cite{matching_cut_ipec,matching_cut_structural,matching_cut_tcs, matching_cut_diameter, matching_cut_planar, matching_cut_series_parallel, stable_cutset_line_graphs}.
In particular, Bonsma~\cite{matching_cut_planar} showed that \pname{Matching Cut} remains \NP-hard for planar graphs of maximum degree four and for planar graphs of girth five;
Le and Randerath~\cite{stable_cutset_line_graphs} gave an \NP-hardness reduction for bipartite graphs of maximum degree four;
Le and Le~\cite{matching_cut_diameter} proved that \pname{Matching Cut} is \NP-hard for graphs of diameter at least three, and presented a polynomial-time algorithm for graphs of diameter at most two.
Beyond planar graphs, Bonsma's work~\cite{matching_cut_planar} also proves that the matching cut property is expressible in monadic second order logic and, by Courcelle's Theorem~\cite{courcelle_theorem}, it follows that \pname{Matching Cut} is $\FPT$ when parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph; he concludes with a proof that the problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm for graphs of bounded cliquewidth.

Kratsch and Le~\cite{matching_cut_tcs} noted that Chv\'atal's original reduction also shows that, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis~\cite{eth} (\ETH) fails\footnote{The $\ETH$ states that 3-\textsc{SAT} on $n$ variables cannot be solved in time $2^{o(n)}$; see~\cite{eth} for more details.}, there is no algorithm solving \pname{Matching Cut} in time $2^{o(n)}$ on $n$-vertex input graphs.
Also in~\cite{matching_cut_tcs}, the authors provide a first branching algorithm, running\footnote{The $\bigOs{\cdot}$ notation suppresses factors that are bounded by a polynomial in the input size.} in time $\bigOs{2^{n/2}}$, a single-exponential $\FPT$ algorithm when parameterized by the vertex cover number $\tau(G)$, and an algorithm generalizing the polynomial cases of line graphs~\cite{matching_cut_moshi} and claw-free graphs~\cite{matching_cut_planar}.
Kratsch and Le~\cite{matching_cut_tcs} also asked for the existence a single-exponential algorithm parameterized by treewidth.
In response, Aravind et al.~\cite{matching_cut_structural} provided a $\bigOs{12^{\tw(G)}}$ algorithm for \pname{Matching Cut} using nice tree decompositions, along with $\FPT$ algorithms for other structural parameters, namely neighborhood diversity, twin-cover, and distance to split graph.

The natural parameter -- the number of edges crossing the cut -- has also been considered.
%\ig{really? In the next sentence you speak about another problem}.
Indeed, Marx et al.~\cite{marx_treewidth_reduction} tackled the \pname{Stable Cutset} problem, to which \textsc{Matching Cut} can be easily reduced via the line graph, and through a breakthrough technique showed that this problem is $\FPT$ when parameterized by the maximum size of the stable cutset.
Recently, Komusiewicz et al.~\cite{matching_cut_ipec} improved on the results of Kratsch and Le~\cite{matching_cut_tcs}, providing an exact exponential algorithm for \textsc{Matching Cut} running in  time $\bigOs{1.3803^n}$, as well as $\FPT$ algorithms parameterized by the distance to a cluster graph and the distance to a co-cluster graph, which improve the algorithm parameterized by the vertex cover number, since both parameters are easily seen to be smaller than the vertex cover number.
For the distance to cluster parameter, they also presented a quadratic kernel; while for a combination of treewidth, maximum degree, and number of crossing edges, they showed that no polynomial kernel exists unless $\NP \subseteq \coNP/\poly$.

A problem  closely related to \pname{$d$-Cut} is that of \pname{Internal Partition}, first studied by Thomassen~\cite{internal_partition_thomassen}.
In this problem, we seek a bipartition of the vertices of an input graph such that every vertex has at least as many neighbors in its
own part as in the other part. Such a partition is called an \tdef{internal partition}.
Usually, the problem is posed in a more general form: given functions $a,b: V(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_+$, we seek a bipartition $(A,B)$ of $V(G)$ such that every $v \in A$ satisfies $\dgr_A(v) \geq a(v)$ and every $u \in B$ satisfies $\dgr_B(u) \geq b(u)$, where $\dgr_A(v)$ denotes the number of neighbors of $v$ in the set $A$. Such a partition is called an \tdef{$(a,b)$-internal partition}.

Originally, Thomassen asked in~\cite{internal_partition_thomassen} whether for any pair of positive integers $s,t$, a graph $G$ with $\delta(G) \geq s + t + 1$ has a vertex bipartition $(A,B)$ with $\delta(G[A]) \geq s$ and $\delta(G[B]) \geq t$.
Stiebitz~\cite{internal_partition_stiebitz} answered that, in fact, for any graph $G$ and any pair of functions $a,b: V(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_+$ satisfying $\dgr(v) \geq a(v) + b(v) + 1$ for every $v \in V(G)$, $G$ has an $(a,b)$-internal partition.
Following Stiebitz's work, Kaneko~\cite{internal_partition_triangle_free} showed that if $G$ is triangle-free, then the pair $a,b$ only needs to satisfy $\dgr(v) \geq a(v) + b(v)$.
More recently, Ma and Yang~\cite{internal_partition_c4_free} proved that, if $G$ is $\{C_4, K_4, \text{diamond}\}$-free, then $\dgr(v) \geq a(v) + b(v) - 1$ is enough.
Furthermore, they also showed, for any pair $a,b$, a family of graphs such that $\dgr(v) \geq a(v) + b(v) - 2$ for every $v \in V(G)$ that do not admit an $(a,b)$-internal partition.

It is conjectured that, for every positive integer $r$, there exists some constant $n_r$ for which every $r$-regular graph with more than $n_r$ vertices has an internal partition~\cite{DeVos09,internal_partition_regular6} (the conjecture for $r$ even appeared first in~\cite{internal_partition_regular3_4}).
The cases $r \in \{3,4\}$ have been settled by Shafique and Dutton~\cite{internal_partition_regular3_4}; the case $r=6$ has been verified by Ban and Linial~\cite{internal_partition_regular6}.
This latter result implies that every 6-regular graph of sufficiently large size has a 3-cut.

\medskip 

\noindent \textbf{Our results}. We aim at generalizing several of the previously reported results  for \pname{Matching Cut}.
First, we show in Section~\ref{sec:np}, by using a reduction inspired by Chvátal's~\cite{chvatal_matching_cut}, that for every $d \geq 1$, \pname{$d$-Cut} is \NP-hard even when restricted to $(2d+2)$-regular graphs and that, if $\Delta(G) \leq d+2$, finding a $d$-cut can be done in polynomial time. The degree bound in the \NP-hardness result is unlikely to be improved: if we had an \NP-hardness result for \textsc{$d$-Cut} restricted to $(2d+1)$-regular graphs, this would disprove the conjecture about the existence of internal partitions on $r$-regular graphs~\cite{DeVos09,internal_partition_regular6,internal_partition_regular3_4} for $r$ odd, unless all the problems in $\NP$ could be solved in \textit{constant} time. We conclude the section by giving a simple exact exponential algorithm that,  for every $d \geq 1$, runs in time $\bigOs{c_d^n}$ for some constant $c_d < 2$, hence improving over the trivial brute-force algorithm running in time $\bigOs{2^n}$.

We then proceed to analyze the problem in terms of its parameterized complexity.
Section~\ref{sec:param} begins with a proof, using the treewidth reduction technique of Marx et al.~\cite{marx_treewidth_reduction}, that \pname{$d$-Cut} is $\FPT$ parameterized by the maximum number of edges crossing the cut.
Afterwards, we present a dynamic programming algorithm for \pname{$d$-Cut} parameterized by treewidth running in time $\bigOs{2^{\tw(G)+1}(d+1)^{2\tw(G) + 2}}$; in particular, for $d=1$ this algorithm runs in time $\bigOs{8^{\tw(G)}}$ and improves the one given by Aravind et al.~\cite{matching_cut_structural} for \pname{Matching Cut}, running in time  $\bigOs{12^{\tw(G)}}$.
By employing the cross-composition framework of Bodlaender et al.~\cite{cross_composition} and using a reduction similar to the one in~\cite{matching_cut_ipec}, we show that, unless $\NP \subseteq \coNP/\poly$, there is no polynomial kernel for \pname{$d$-Cut} parameterized simultaneously by the number of crossing edges, the maximum degree, and the treewidth of the input graph.
We then present a polynomial kernel and an $\FPT$ algorithm when parameterizing by the distance to cluster, denoted by $\dc(G)$. This polynomial kernel is our main technical contribution, and it is strongly inspired by the technique presented by  Komusiewicz et al.~\cite{matching_cut_ipec} for \textsc{Matching Cut}. Finally, we give an $\FPT$ algorithm parameterized by the distance to co-cluster, denoted by $\dcc(G)$.
These results imply fixed-parameter tractability for \pname{$d$-Cut} parameterized by $\tau(G)$. 

We present in Section~\ref{sec:concl} our concluding remarks and some open questions. We start by providing some basic preliminaries in Section~\ref{sec:prelim}.
