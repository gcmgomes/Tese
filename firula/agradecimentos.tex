I'd like to deeply thank everyone that somehow was a part of this process.
My family, for their unwavering support, from the moment I started this doctorate until now.
All my friends, who were always full of jokes (specially during the apparently endless mid-afternoon breaks), encouragement, ideas and discussions, making the daily research feel much lighter and enjoyable than it could otherwise have been.
Jacqueline, for listening to my endless musings about graphs with a million properties that made exactly zero sense to anyone - me included - and being exactly who she is.

I'd really like to thank Vin√≠cius for accepting me as his student, specially after a year and a half spent on a completely different subject and not much that could be salvaged.
I'd also like to thank Carlos for being such a massive addition to the team, squashing bugs on the more delicate proofs, presenting outright great advice, speeding things up considerably, and also being a great friend.
Last, but definitely not least, I'd like to thank Ignasi for supervising me during my internship at LIRMM, even though we hadn't known each other for long.

It was an honour and priviledge to work with and live alongside each of you.
Nothing would be the same without you.
