I'd like to deeply thank everyone that somehow was a part of this process.
My family, for their unwavering support, from the moment I started this doctorate until now.
All my friends, who were always full of jokes (specially during the apparently endless mid-afternoon breaks), encouragement, ideas and discussions, making the daily research feel much lighter and enjoyable than it could otherwise have been.
Jacqueline, for listening to my endless musings about graphs with a million properties that made exactly zero sense to anyone - me included - and being exactly who she is.

I'd really like to thank Vin√≠cius for accepting me as his student, specially after a year and a half spent on a completely different subject and not much that could be salvaged.
Along the academic lines, I'd also like to thank Carlos for being such a massive addition to the team, squashing bugs on the more delicate proofs, presenting outright great advice and speeding things up considerably.
I should also thank everyone that I dragged to the whiteboard to explain some (usually very wrong) idea.
Nothing would be the same without you.
